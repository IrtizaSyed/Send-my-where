		<span>What is Send Anywhere?</span>
		<p>
			Send Anywhere is a file sharing application that takes an easy, quick,
			and unlimited approach to file sharing. Cloud sharing or storage
			services often offer a promise of unlimited file storing and sharing
			but their speeds and usability is compromised. Send Anywhere is for
			anyone wanting to share quality content, quickly, from any device to
			anyone in the world.

				<span>I am in sales and I work with multiple devices, a pc in my office

					service that would allow me to work in different places. Before I
					discovered Send Anywhere, I had to upload large files to cloud
					storage and download it to the device I would be working on at the
					moment or use a USB cable to transfer files. With Send Anywhere
					though, I can send files across multiple platforms easily, even to
					China! The user interface is super easy and I always introduce it to
					my friends. I really appreciate the service and have it on every
					device I own. Thank you Send Anywhere!</span>

				<span>Hello, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for this service. You may not know this, but

					saved our asses many times, often right before the showtime. So, we just wanted to thank you!</span>
